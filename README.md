# Hackathon-ELEVEN
ML project (ELEVEN Strategy) predicting short-term wait times in amusement parks

## Project Overview
This project predicts waiting times in amusement parks over the next 2 hours using the dataset ELEVEN Strategy provided us with. Developed as part of a hackathon, the project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The project won the hackathon for its predictive performance and modeling approach.

## Data
- Dataset: [brief description, e.g., 10,000 records of ride wait times and park features]  
- Features: ride type, time of day, day of week, visitor flow, weather conditions  
- Preprocessing: handled missing values, normalized numerical features, encoded categorical variables

## Approach
- Models used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
- Feature selection and engineering applied to improve model performance  
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation

## Results
- RMSE decreased from **X** (baseline) to **Y** (final model)  
- Final model achieved **winning performance in the hackathon**  
- Visualizations:
  - Include a small figure showing predicted vs actual wait times  
  - Optional: feature importance plot to highlight key predictors
